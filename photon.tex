\chapter{Photon induced background}
\label{cha:photon}
Since the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay of $^{76}$Ge has a $Q$-value of
2.039~MeV, $\gamma$-rays with energies larger than 2.039~MeV are the
main background source for GERDA. Fortunately, the spatial
distribution of photon interactions with germanium differs from
electron interactions with germanium, see
Sec.~\ref{sec:det:phys}. Segmented germanium detectors are considered
for use in GERDA Phase II in order to identify photon induced
background. The discrimination power of segmented germanium detectors
was examined systematically \cite{Pid07} using the GERDA Phase II
prototype detector Siegfried I (see Sec.~\ref{sec:gerda:stat3}) and
its test stand (see Sec.~\ref{sec:tt:comc}). The main results are
summarized in this chapter.

MaGe \cite{Mag06, Mag08} is a C++ simulation package co-developed by
the Majorana and GERDA collaborations based on Geant4 toolkits
\cite{Gea03, Gea06}. It was used for the simulation of GERDA and the
detector test facilities in Munich. The predictions for photon induced
events were verified to be accurate for a wide range of conditions.

\section{Event classification}
\label{sec:ph:eve}
As described in Sec.~\ref{sec:det:gamma} a photon with an energy of
the order of one MeV has a mean free path of several centimeters in a
germanium crystal. It most probably deposits energy in several
different places and creates a \emph{multi-site event}. On the other
hand, the average range of a 1~MeV electron in germanium is about
0.5~mm (see Sec.~\ref{sec:det:ep}). Since the probability for
Bremsstrahlung is low, electrons mainly create \emph{single-site
events} with most of the energy deposited within a radius of 1~mm. The
size of the segments was chosen such that electrons predominantly
create \emph{single-segment events} while photons result in
\emph{multi-segment events}.

Figure~\ref{fig:ph:eve} depicts four possible event configurations. By
requiring anti-coincidence most of the photon induced background
events can be rejected. However, there are still some photon induced
multi-site events with energy deposits in one segment only, as shown
in bottom left corner of Fig.~\ref{fig:ph:eve}. This kind of event can
be further identified using pulse shape analysis.

A single-site event can also be a multi-segment event if it happens to
occur on the boundary of two neighboring segments and induces signals
in both segments, as shown in the top right corner of
Fig.~\ref{fig:ph:eve}. This kind of event will be rejected erroneously
by the anti-coincidence requirement, and should also be identified
using pulse shape analysis.

Siegfried-like detector is depicted. The black dots are hits (energy

\end{figure}

\section{Background rejection using segmentation}
\label{sec:ph:seg}
Different data samples were taken using the segmented germanium
detector Siegfried I (see Sec.~\ref{sec:gerda:stat3}) and its test
stand (see Sec.~\ref{sec:tt:comc}) with $^{228}$Th and $^{60}$Co
$\gamma$ sources placed 10~cm above the vacuum cryostat (see
Fig.~\ref{fig:tt:comcryo}). Figure~\ref{fig:ph:seg} taken from
Ref.~\cite{Pid07} shows the core energy spectrum of the $^{228}$Th
data sample for all events (black) and single-segment events
(grey). The double escape peak\footnote{A double-escape-peak event is
created as follows: a photon produces a pair of electron and positron
inside the detector, the positron losses all its energy and
annihilates with another electron resulting in two 511~keV photons,
and both of the photons escape from the detector. Since the energy is
deposited only by an electron and a positron within a small region,
the double-escape-peak event is a single-site event.} (DEP in short)
from $^{208}$Tl ($1\,593$~keV) is hardly suppressed since the DEP
events are mostly single-segment events; while the $^{212}$Bi line
($1\,620$~keV) is suppressed by a factor of $2.85 \pm 0.01$ since most
of the events inside the peak are photon induced multi-segment events.

\section{Monte Carlo simulation}
\label{sec:ph:sim}
Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of prototype detectors and their
cryostats were performed using MaGe \cite{Mag06, Mag08}, a C++ package
co-developed by the Majorana and GERDA collaborations using the Geant4
toolkits \cite{Gea03, Gea06}. Figure~\ref{fig:ph:sim} shows the
geometrical models of the detectors and cryostats implemented in
Geant4. Figure~\ref{fig:ph:s2} shows a close-up of Siegfried~II. It
was modeled in such a way that the details were implemented as close
as possible to reality while the speed of simulation did not decrease
too much.

\end{figure}

The energy deposits of hits in each segment were recorded and the core
energy was calculated by adding all segment energies. The segment and
core energies were individually smeared according to the energy
resolutions of the detectors measured in the individual channels.

The spatial and time information of hits were also recorded and served
as parts of the input for the pulse shape simulation package. The
geometry of detectors and the voltage bias applied were other input
information for the pulse shape simulation. The details of the pulse
shape simulation are described in Chapter~\ref{cha:pss}.

\section{Verification of the Monte Carlo}
\label{sec:ph:var}

The simulation of photon interactions was done with Geant4.8.1 patch
2, and verified for (a) the energy spectrum, (b) the occupancy of each
segment, namely, the number of events recorded by each segment (see
Fig.~\ref{fig:ph:occ} for measurement setup), (c) the multiplicity,
namely, the number of segments having signals, and (d) the line
suppression factors (SF$_{\text{L}}$) defined as the ratio of the
total number of events to the number of single-segment events within
the energy window $[E_{\gamma} - 3\sigma, E_{\gamma} + 3\sigma]$,
where $E_{\gamma}$ is the central energy of the gamma line and
$\sigma$ is the energy resolution of the line.\footnote{The
suppression factors were calculated after the background was
subtracted.} The simulated distributions of (a), (b) and (c) were
added to the background distribution measured, and then compared to
the data as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ph:mc}a, b and c. The line
suppression factors were calculated for data and MC, respectively, and
then compared to each other as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ph:mcd}.

from Ref.~\cite{Pid07}.}
\label{fig:ph:mc}
\end{figure}

The MC simulation agrees very well with the data in general. However,
there are some discrepencies observed in different aspects.

As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ph:mca}, the low energy side of the 1332~keV
peak in the data is significantly higher than in MC. This could be due
to the surface channel effect as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:np:exp}.

The occupancy distribution as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ph:mcb} was
measured with the experimental setup shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:ph:occ}. The $\gamma$ source was placed above the center
of the detector. Naturally, the top layer of the detector (segment
No. 13 - 18\footnote{The segment naming scheme used here is different
from that shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ger:segm} so that segments in the
same layer can be plotted aside each other.}) had the highest event
rates, the bottom layer (segment No. 1 - 6) had the lowest event
rates. The event rates of different segments in the same layer should
have been equal because the distance between the source and any of the
segments was the same (see Fig.~\ref{fig:ph:occ}b). However, this is
not the case as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ph:mcb}. This is because the
drift of charge carriers is affected by the structure of the germanium
crystal; the drift trajectories do not exactly follow the electric
field lines. This effect cannot be simulated using Geant4. An
effective model was used to tune the simulated distribution in order
to minimize the discrepancy between MC and data. The development of a
full simulation of the drift of the charge carriers in germanium
detectors is described in Chapters~\ref{cha:pss} and \ref{cha:psa}.

There is a deviation of 5\% between data and Monte Carlo plus
background data for multiplicities up to three. For higher
multiplicities the data exceeds the Monte Carlo with increasing
multiplicity. This may due to the fact that a hit close to the segment
boundary is always assigned to one segment in simulation while in
reality it may induce signals in several segment nearby.
