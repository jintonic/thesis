Neutrinos were introduced into the \emph{Standard Model} as massless
particles. But strong evidences from neutrino oscillations expriments
showed that at least one of the neutrinos had mass. In order to
include neutrino mass into the \emph{Standard Model} without
conflicting with the fact that neither right handed neutrinos nor left
handed antineutrinos are observed, neutrinos are assume to be of
Majorana type, \textit{i.e.} their own anti-particles. Neutrinoless
double beta decay would exist only if this assumption is true. And
from the rate of Neutrinoless double beta decay the effective Majorana
neutrino mass can be deduced. This can help to solve the neutrino mass
hierarchy problem that cannot be solved by the neutrino oscillation
experiment alone. There are approaches other than neutrinoless double
beta decay which can also address on the same problem. But they are
not quite practical for the time being.

\section{Neutrinos in \emph{Standard Model}}
\label{sec:sm}
In \emph{Standard Model} neutrinos are assumed to be fermions with
spin 1/2 and rest mass $m_\mu=0$. They always have fixed helicities
because there is no frame of reference moving faster than a neutrino,
where the helicity of the neutrino could change its sign. Neutrinos
and anti-neutrinos are believed to be different particles. Lepton
numbers +1 and -1 are asssigned to them respectively and required to
be conservative in order to indicate the difference. Only left-handed
neutrinos and right-handed anti-neutrinos participate the weak
interaction.

In order to explain the continuous energy spectrum of electrons
emitted from the beta decay without abandoning the law of energy
conservation W. Pauli postulated in 1930 that there was another
particle except for the eletron emitted in the beta decay. He called
it ``neutron'' and assumed that it should have spin 1/2, its mass be
of the same order of magnitude as the electron mass, and its
penetrating power be 1-10 times larger than a
$\gamma$-ray.~\cite{Pau30} E. Fermi renamed it ``neutrino'' to
distinguish it from the heavier neutron discovered by J. Chadwick in
1932 and developed his theory of beta decay according to the beta
spectrum~\cite{Fer33,Fer34}. He investigated the influence of the
neutrino mass on the shape of beta spectrum. F. Perrin carried out
similar results at the same time independently~\cite{Per33}. They
inferred that $m_\nu \approx 0$ by comparing their calculation with
the experimental beta spectrum. A precise measurement of the beta
spectrum of tritium by L. Langer and R. Moffat in 1952~\cite{Lan52}
gave an upper limit on the rest mass of the neutrino,
$$m_\nu < 250 \mbox{eV} = 0.002m_e.$$
The neutrino was assumed to be massless afterwards.

For massless fermions there was a so-called two-component model, which
was mentioned for the first time by H. Weyl~\cite{Wey29}. According to
this model there are only two right-handed components or two
left-handed components exist in nature. It was always rejected because
it intrinsically violated the parity conservation, which, at that
time, was believed to be true. This idea was applied to the neutrino
again by Lee and Yang~\cite{Lee57}, and some other
authors~\cite{Sal57,Lan57} soon after the parity
violation~\cite{Lee56} was observed in the beta decay of
$^{60}$Co~\cite{Wu57} and the creation and decay of
muons~\cite{Gar57,Fri57}. This idea was widely accepted after an
elegant experiment carried out by M. Goldhaber \textit{et
  al.}~\cite{Gol58}. By measuring the polarization of $\gamma$-rays
emitted from $^{152}$Sm* created in the electron capture
$^{152}$Eu$(e^-,\nu)$ they inferred that neutrinos from
$^{152}$Eu$(e^-,\nu)$ were left-handed.

Based on these theoretical development and experimental observations
the \emph{Standard Model} of weak interaction was established. In this
model neutrinos are massless and only left-handed neutrinos and
right-handed anti-neutrinos participate the weak interaction.
