The GERDA (GERmanium Detector Array) experiment~\cite{Abt04, Sch05} is designed to search for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay of $^{76}$Ge. The main design feature is to operate ``naked'' germanium detectors directly in liquid argon in order to achieve an extremely low background levels. The concept is based on ideas presented in Ref~\cite{Heu95}. A detailed introduction to the experiment is given in the first section of this chapter. GERDA is currently under construction in Hall A of the INFN Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS), Italy. The current status of the experiment is described in the second section. The development of GERDA is divided into three phases. In the first phase (Phase I) unsegmented germanium detectors, which were previously used in the IGEX~\cite{Aal02} and HdM~\cite{Hei04} experiments, will be re-deployed. The envisioned background level is $10^{-2}$~events/(kg$\cdot$keV$\cdot$year). In the second phase (Phase II) 18-fold segmented detectors will be used in addition. The background level aimed at is $10^{-3}$~events/(kg$\cdot$keV$\cdot$year). A later phase (Phase III) is under discussion in cooperation with the MAJORANA Collaboration~\cite{Gai03,Aal04} aiming at a one ton scale experiment. The physics observation capabilities of the three phases of GERDA are discussed in the last section.

\section{Background reduction techniques}
\label{sec:gerda:conc}
Germanium detectors have been used to detect ionizing radiation, particularly X-rays and $\gamma$-rays, for years. The energy resolution is typically better than 1\% around the $Q$-value of the $^{76}$Ge $\beta\beta$ decay. This is among the best of all detectors introduced in Sec.~\ref{sec:gencon} and provides a very good separation between the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay signal and the $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay background. However, the natural abundance of $^{76}$Ge (7.6\%) is not very high, and enrichment is needed. In addition, the $Q$-value of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay of $^{76}$Ge, 2.039~MeV, is lower than some lines prominent in natural radioactivity. Therefore the design of the experiment has to minimize the amount of radioactive elements in the vicinity of the detectors. Fig.~\ref{fig:gerda} is an artist view of GERDA. Each part of the experiment is introduced in the following sections and its function in reducing background is discussed.

\begin{figure}[tbhp]

  \label{fig:gerda}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Underground location and muon veto}
\label{sec:gerda:loca}
To reduce the cosmic ray induced background GERDA is located underground, in Hall A of the INFN~\footnote{Istituto Nazionale di   Fisica Nucleare} Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS), Italy. LNGS is the largest underground facility in the world for low-background experiments. It is accessed from the 10~km long highway tunnel under the Gran Sasso mountains. It has three experimental halls hosting a large variety of experiments, most of which focus on dark matter or neutrino physics. Fig.~\ref{fig:lngs} shows the location of GERDA inside LNGS. The main experimental site of GERDA is between the Large Volume Detector (LVD) and the service tunnel crossing Hall A. The GERDA auxiliary and cryogenic storage system will be located in the service tunnel on the northeast side of Hall A.

\begin{figure}[tbhp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{lngs}  
  \caption{Location of GERDA inside LNGS. The main experimental site     of GERDA is between the Large Volume Detector (LVD) and a service     tunnel crossing Hall A. The GERDA auxiliary and cryogenic storage     system will be located in the service tunnel on the northeast side     of Hall A.}
  \label{fig:lngs}
\end{figure}

The overburden of 1.4~km of rock above the experimental halls corresponds to 3400 meter of water equivalent (m.w.e). It reduces the cosmic ray induced muon (neutron) flux by a factor of $10^{6}$ ($10^{3}$) compared to the surface. The energy and angular distributions of cosmic ray muons in Hall A of LNGS have been precisely measured~\cite{Amb95, Lip91, Amb03}. A comprehensive study of cosmic ray induced muon and neutron background in underground laboratories can be found in Ref.~\cite{Mei06}.

In order to further reduce the muon induced background an additional muon veto system will be installed. Cosmic muons traversing the water tank (see Fig.\ref{fig:gerda}) will cause \u{C}erenkov radiation. To detect the radiation 66 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) will be installed on the walls of the water tank. The positions of PMTs are optimized according to Monte Carlo simulation. The detection efficiency is about 95\% depending on the incident angle of the muon. In order to compensate for the missing water around the neck of the cryostat plastic scintillator plates will be placed on top of the clean room. They are used to detect the muons entering the cryostat almost vertically. The combined detection efficiency is expected to be above 99\%.

\subsection{Water tank and cryostat}
\label{sec:gerda:rock}
To shield against neutron radiation from the surrounding rocks about 630~m$^{3}$ of ultra-pure water will be filled in a stainless steel tank with an outer diameter of 10~m and a height of about 8~m. There is a stainless steel cryostat with an internal copper lining inside the water tank. The height of the vessel is 5.88~m (7.62~m with the neck) with an outer diameter of 4.16~m. It can contain 98~t of liquid argon. As liquid argon can be produced with a much greater purity than lead or even copper traditionally used for shielding, this minimizes the radioactivity close to the detector array. The liquid argon also acts as a shield against $\gamma$-rays, especially provided by the cryostat itself.

\subsection{Detector suspension system and electronics}
\label{sec:gerda:cable}
The germanium detectors will be lowered into liquid argon from the top of the cryostat. In order to minimize the radioactivity in the suspension system low mass detector holders and minimal cabling will be used (See Fig.~\ref{fig:holder1} and \ref{fig:holder2}). The holders are made of thin ultra-pure copper with a total weight of about 30~g per detector. They are chained together vertically into strings. Each string consists of 3 detectors of the same type, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:array2}. The whole detector array could maximally consists of 16 hexagonally packed detector strings as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:atop}. 

The horizontal distance between the centers of two detectors is 9~cm. The vertical clearance between two detectors is about 6~cm. The Phase I detectors are p-type diodes with a cylindrical closed-ended coaxial geometry. The detectors are enriched in $^{76}$Ge to a level of about 86\% and have masses between 0.9~kg and 2.9~kg. The detectors for Phase II will be cylindrical true coaxial n-type diodes. The precise size of the detectors will depend on manufacturing details. The most likely dimensions are a height of 70~mm and a diameter of 75~mm. The detectors will be segmented 6-fold in the azimuthal angle $\phi$ and a 3-fold in the height z.

  \label{fig:array}
\end{figure}

A couple of solutions are actively pursued for the read-out electronics of GERDA~\cite{Cat07}. A likely scheme foresees a cold FET close to the crystal followed by amplifying and load driving circuits located at room temperature. The cold FET would be placed near the connection matrix (top blocks in Fig.~\ref{fig:array2}), 30~cm above the detector array. Pre-amplified signals would be sent to electronics located outside the lock system at room temperature through at least 6~m long cables.

\subsection{Detector storage and clean room}
\label{sec:gerda:source}
Whenever above ground, germanium detectors are exposed to cosmic radiation and radioactive isotopes are produced inside the detector through spallation caused by energetic cosmic rays. Two cosmogenic isotopes, $^{60}$Co and $^{68}$Ge, have Q-values above that of $^{76}$Ge $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay and are potential sources of background. Therefore the time above ground needs to be minimized. Since the half life time of $^{60}$Co and $^{68}$Ge is 5.3 years and 271 days, respectively, a passive method to reduce the contamination is to keep the detectors long enough underground and wait for it to decay.

When exposed to air the surface a germanium detector can collect dust which contains many radioactive isotopes, particularly Pb$^{214}$, undergoing $\alpha$ decay. Some parts of the detector surface are not fully charge sensitive and only part of the energy lost by the $\alpha$ particle can be detected. This may result in a signal close to the $Q$-value of the $^{76}$Ge $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay. Therefore the testing, preparation and insertion of the detector has to be done in a clean environment. For this purpose, a class 10000 clean room with radon-reduced air will be built on top of the cryostat. It houses a lock, through which detector strings are inserted into and removed from the cryogenic volume. Detector handling will be performed in flow-boxes and a detector mounting-station which will reach class 100.  The lock consists of a rail system which allows to move detector strings into their correct position and lower them into the cryostat. In addition, the clean room will be used to temporarily store germanium detectors in a controlled atmosphere of gaseous argon as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:store}.

\end{figure}

\section{Background rejection methods}
\label{sec:gerda:anti}
Even though the experimental setup is optimized to reduce the creation of potential background radiation as much as possible, there are still some photons which may reach the detector array; and some meta stable isotopes created inside the detectors by cosmic muon induced neutrons are also potential background sources. Methods to identify and reject these remain background events are described in this section.

\subsection{Spacial anti-coincidence} 
\label{sec:gerda:santi}
Compton-scattered photons are likely to deposit energy in more than one detector (see Sec.~\ref{sec:det:gamma}) while $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay electrons will predominantly deposit energy in only one detector. Photons can thus be identified by requiring more than one detector to see energy above the threshold. Considering the segmented detectors for Phase II photons depositing energy in one crystal can still be identified by requiring more than one segment to show energy.~\cite{Sipid}

\subsection{Time anti-coincidence} 
\label{sec:gerda:tanti}
Since meta stable isotopes created inside the detectors by cosmic muon induced neutrons, such as the meta stable states of $^{68}$Ge and $^{77}$Ge, do not decay right after the original muon event, muon veto with narrow time window can do very little to reject the background induced by delayed decays. This can be overcome by introducing time anti-coincidence between the original muon event and the later decays. Feasibility studies are currently carried out.

\subsection{Pulse shape analysis}
\label{sec:gerda:psa}
Although photons are likely to create more than one energy deposition, they could all be in one segment; the anti-coincidence between segments cannot identify this kind of event. However, by analyzing the time structure of the detector response, \textit{i.e.} pulse shape, photon induced events can still be identified~\cite{Kev07}.

\subsection{Instrumentation of the cryostat}
\label{sec:gerda:scint}
Liquid argon scintillates if energy is deposited inside the argon volume. The scintillation light can be detected by PMT's mounted on the walls of the cryostat.  Events with photons in the final state which deposit only a fraction of their energy inside the germanium detectors can be vetoed by requiring an anti-coincidence between the observed scintillation light and the energy deposit inside the detectors.  This technique is not part of the GERDA baseline design. Feasibility studies are currently being performed~\cite{Pei05, Orr06}.

\section{Status}
\label{sec:gerda:stat}
This section closes with the status of GERDA as of Winter 2008/09. Important milestones are discussed below.  

\subsection{Cryostat and water tank}
\label{sec:gerda:stat1}
On March 6, 2008, the cryostat was delivered to LNGS and placed at the foreseen location in Hall A (see Fig.~\ref{fig:cryostat}). Mounting of the internal copper shield was completed on March 18. The cryostat underwent pressure tests, helium leak tests, liquid nitrogen evaporation tests and radon emanation measurements. The water tank installation finished at the end of June (see Fig.~\ref{fig:waterTank}). The installations of the cryostat and water tank were major milestones for GERDA.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Clean room and lock system}
\label{sec:gerda:stat2}
Figure~\ref{fig:waterTank} shows the first parts of the superstructure around the water tank, on top of which the clean room and lock will be built. The design of the clean room is finished. The construction is scheduled to finish in February 2009. The design of the complete lock structure is almost finished. The lock will be preinstalled at the Max-Planck-Institut f\"ur Physik in Munich and then transported to the LNGS in 2009. A provisional lock system is in production. It will be used before the complete lock system is ready so that the commissioning of GERDA can start at February 2009.

\subsection{Phase I and II detectors}
\label{sec:gerda:stat3}
In total 17.9~kg of enriched and 15~kg of non-enriched high-purity p-type germanium detectors from IGEX\cite{Aal02}, HdM~\cite{Hei04} and the Genius Test Facility (GTF)~\cite{Kla02} will be operated in Phase I of GERDA. Stability tests of the operation of p-type detectors in cryogenic liquids are practically completed. 

A total of 37.5~kg of enriched germanium was procured for GERDA Phase II detectors. It has an enrichment level of about 90\% and is stored in the HADES facility in the form of GeO$_{2}$. The purification tests with depleted germanium have shown that the yield is about 90\%, and the exposure time above ground will not exceed $2 \sim 3$ days. The resulting 6N material will be transformed into crystals by the Institut f\"ur Kristallz\"uchtung (IKZ) in Berlin. Crystals with a concentration of impurities between $10^{12}$ and $10^{11}$ per cm$^{3}$ have been pulled at IKZ, see Fig.~\ref{fig:pulling}. The \u{C}zochralski puller was already refurbished to produce larger crystals.

  \label{fig:pulling}
\end{figure}

The first two prototype detectors for GERDA Phase~II were developed and produced in close collaboration with the manufacturer Canberra-France, and called Siegfried I and Siegfried II. The Siegfried series are $n$-type true coaxial cylindrical crystals made of natural germanium with a height of 70~mm and a diameter of 75~mm with a 10~mm hole in the center. The active volume is 302~cm$^{3}$, the total mass is 1.6~kg. They are 18-fold segmented with a 6-fold segmentation in the azimuthal angle $\phi$ and a 3-fold segmentation in the height $z$. The segmentation scheme and the detector coordinate system are depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:ger:segm} where a scheme of the cabling (left) and the segment numbering (right) are shown. The segments are read out using a Kapton flexible printed-circuit-board (FPCB) with snap-contacts~\cite{Sie07}. Pictures of the two detectors together with the contact cables are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ger:sies}. The detector specifications as provided by Canberra-France are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:tt:detpar}.

  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Siegfried I was operated in a conventional cryostat and extensively
tested and characterized~\cite{Sie07}. Siegfried II was operated in
liquid nitrogen for five months. The handling, operating and testing
of the prototype detectors and the physics analysis based on the data
from them are the main topics of this thesis and will be discussed in
detail in the following chapters.

\section{Sensitivity}
\label{sec:gerda:sens}
A dedicated discussion of the sensitivity of GERDA can be found in Ref.~\cite{Cal06}. Figure~\ref{fig:ger:llife} taken from Ref.~\cite{Cal06} shows the expected 90\% probability lower limit on the half lifetime of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay versus the exposure under different background conditions. Also shown is the half lifetime for the claimed observation by H. V. Klapdor-Kleingrothaus \textit{et   al.}~\cite{Hei04}. Figure~\ref{fig:ger:lmass} shows the expected 90\% probability upper limit on the effective Majorana neutrino mass versus the exposure under different background conditions. The effective Majorana neutrino mass for the claimed observation is also shown. All mass values are determined from the half lifetime using the matrix elements reported in Ref~\cite{Rod07}.

  \label{fig:gerda:limit}
\end{figure}

For GERDA Phase I, assuming a background level of $10^{-2}$~events/(kg$\cdot$keV$\cdot$year) and an exposure of
100~(kg$\cdot$year), an upper limit on $m_{\beta\beta}$ of
0.3~eV would be achievable. For Phase II, assuming a background level of $10^{-3}$~events/(kg$\cdot$keV$\cdot$year) and an exposure of
100~(kg$\cdot$year), an upper limit on $m_{\beta\beta}$ of
0.2~eV would be achievable.
