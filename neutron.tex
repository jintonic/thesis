\chapter{Neutron induced background}
\label{cha:neutron}
Neutrons produced near the germanium detectors by penetrating cosmic-ray muons can induce background events. In addition, neutrons from $(\alpha, n)$ reactions in the surrounding rock are also a potential source of background. The study of neutron interactions with germanium isotopes as well as the surrounding materials is thus of great interest.

It was shown in the previous chapter that segmented germanium detectors are powerful tools to identify photon induced background. In this chapter an investigation whether segment information can also help to identify neutron induced background is presented. It was also shown in the previous chapter that MaGe \cite{Mag06, Mag08} simulates photon induced background well. The verification of MaGe with respect to neutron interactions is presented in this chapter.

The first GERDA Phase II prototype detector Siegfried I (see Sec.~\ref{sec:gerda:stat3}) was exposed to neutrons from an AmBe source to obtain the necessary data.

\section{Experimental setup and data sets}
\label{sec:neu:exp}
The schematic of the experimental setup is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:neu:exp}. The detector Siegfried~I (see Sec.~\ref{sec:gerda:stat3}) was operated in the vacuum cryostat introduced in Sec.~\ref{sec:tt:comc}. It was exposed to an AmBe neutron source encased in a cylindrical paraffin collimator. The center of the collimator was vertically aligned to the center of the detector and the distance between source and detector center was about 1~m.

\end{figure}

The AmBe neutron source had an activity of 1.1~GBq. The energy spectrum of neutrons emitted from $^{9}$Be$(\alpha,n)^{12}$C$^{*}$ nuclear reaction extends to 12~MeV. High resolution measurements of such neutron energy spectra are presented in Ref.~\cite{Mar95, Gei75}. The emittance of photons from the de-excitation of $^{12}$C$^{*}$ is described in Ref.~\cite{Gei75}.

The front-end electronics and the DAQ system were described in Sec.~\ref{sec:tt:fend} and Sec.~\ref{sec:tt:daq}, respectively. The DAQ system was configured such that if two pulses occurred within 240~ns they were added up to a single signal; if the second pulse occurred 240~ns to 8~$\mu$s after the first one, it was disregarded. Two different gain factors were chosen for four different measurements. The low gain factor was chosen so that the energy range up to $\sim 11$~MeV was covered. The high gain factor was chosen for measurements up to $\sim 3$~MeV. Two measurements were performed with the AmBe source present. They are referred to as HGdat (High Gain data) and LGdat (Low Gain data). In order to determine the background from the laboratory environment two more measurements without the source were performed. They are referred to as HGbg (High Gain background) and LGbg (Low Gain background). The data samples with different gains were combined below 3~MeV. The data sets are listed in Table~\ref{tab:neu:datset}.

\section{Core spectra}
\label{sec:neu:spec}
The total energy deposited in the germanium crystal was read out through the core electrode of the detector. Figure~\ref{fig:neu:spec} shows the core energy spectra for data and background in the range of [0.08, 3]~MeV. The trigger thresholds were set such that the spectra above 100~keV were not affected.

\begin{figure}[tbhp]

    with their energies in keV.}
  \label{fig:neu:spec}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:neu:specl} shows the spectra in the range of [3, 10.2]~MeV. In this energy range the background is small, as there are hardly any radioactive elements producing photons with such high energies.

  \label{fig:neu:specl}
\end{figure}

For Fig.~\ref{fig:neu:spec} and \ref{fig:neu:specl} the background was normalized using eight photon peaks associated with the decays of $^{214}$Pb (352~keV), $^{214}$Bi (609~keV, 1120~keV, 1764~keV, 2448~keV), $^{228}$Ac (911~keV), $^{40}$K (1461~keV), and $^{208}$Tl (2615~keV). A Gaussian function plus a first-order polynomial was fitted to each peak in data and background. The ratios of numbers of events in each peak from data and background was taken as scaling factors. The average, $1.279 \pm 0.003$, was taken as an overall scaling factor to normalize the background spectrum.

To illustrate the neutron interactions more clearly the normalized background was subtracted from the data. This is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:neu:specd}. Some of the less prominent structures were washed out, since a larger bin width was chosen for statistical reasons.

\section{Neutron interactions as seen by the core}
\label{sec:neu:type}
The main interaction mechanisms of neutrons with energies less than 12~MeV are thermal capture, inelastic and elastic scattering. Elastic scattering does not induce identifiable peaks in the spectrum, because there is no photon emitted and the recoil energy distribution is too broad. 

The identification of the observed peaks is complex. Not only the production mechanism of the excited nucleus is important. The de-excitation mechanism also has to be taken into account. In most cases the nucleus de-excites instantaneously with the emission of one or more photons. However, it can also undergo internal conversion, in which case an electron from a lower shell is emitted instead of a photon. The excited nucleus can also be meta-stable and not de-excite instantaneously.

Table~\ref{tab:neu:type} lists the processes identified in the core energy spectrum. If inelastic scattering happens inside the germanium crystal, the nuclear recoil energy is recorded as well as the energies from some of the prompt photons. In case of instantaneous de-excitation they are summed up: $E_{inelastic} = E_{\gamma} + E_{recoil}$. This causes an asymmetric peak with a long recoil tail on the high energy side. Internal conversions only create identifiable peaks, if they occur inside the crystal, otherwise the emitted electrons do not reach the detector.

\end{table}

Table~\ref{tab:neu:peak}, \ref{tab:neu:peak2} list all the peaks observed in the core energy spectrum due to neutron interactions within the germanium crystal as well as within the surrounding materials: H, C, Cl in the paraffin collimator, Al, Ce in the aluminum vacuum can and Fe, Cu in the support and the detector and electronics infrastructure.

Purely photon induced peaks were fitted with a Gaussian function plus a first-order polynomial to get the mean energies, FWHMs and the numbers of events in the peaks. The 596~keV peak from $^{74}$Ge$(n, n^\prime \gamma)$ inelastic scattering does not have a Gaussian distribution. The treatment of this peak is described in section~\ref{sec:neu:seg}. The 662~keV peak associated with $^{140}$Ce has a significant background contribution from $^{137}$Cs. This was subtracted. The 692~keV peak from $^{72}$Ge$(n,n^\prime e)$ is hard to fit because it is asymmetric and broad. It is also contaminated by other peaks nearby. The number of events in this peak was estimated by integration.

The 4.4 MeV peak is due to photons from the de-excitation of $^{12}$C$^{*}$ created in the AmBe source by the interaction, $^{9}$Be$(\alpha,n)^{12}$C$^{*}$. It is Doppler broadened because of the movement of the $^{12}$C$^{*}$ nuclei. The width of this peak listed in Table~\ref{tab:neu:peak2} was determined by the fit. Because of low statistics the widths of most of the peaks above 6 MeV had to be fixed in the fitting procedure according to the detector resolution around these energies. The peaks that are not identified are marked with a question mark.

\section{Neutron interactions as seen by the segments}
\label{sec:neu:seg}
The segment energies read out individually provide more information about the interactions inside the germanium crystal than the core signal alone.

\subsection{Neutron inelastic scattering}
A special characteristic of neutron inelastic scattering in a germanium detector is, that not only the photon energy, but also the recoil energy is recorded. The associated peak in the core spectrum has a high energy recoil tail and, hence, is much less significant than a pure photon peak with the same number of events, see Fig.~\ref{fig:neu:spec}. It is possible to partially separate out the recoil energy distribution using information from the individual segments. This is due to the way a segmented detector can provide information about event topologies.

Figure~\ref{fig:neu:inel} shows the three types of events contributing to inelastic scattering peaks in the core spectrum. In all cases the scattered neutron escapes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the nuclear recoil energy and the prompt photon energy are deposited in the same segment;
\item the nuclear recoil energy is deposited within one segment, the prompt photon deposits its energy in several other segments;
\item the nuclear recoil energy is deposited within one segment while the prompt photon deposits its total energy within another segment.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[tbhp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{ine_1}
\caption{Three topologies of neutron inelastic scattering inside a germanium crystal.}
\label{fig:neu:inel}
\end{figure}

In the first case, only one segment has a signal. The energies recorded by the core and the segment are the same, i.e. $E_{core} = E_{seg} = E_{\gamma} + E_{recoil}$. Segmentation cannot help to disentangle the two energies. In the second case, the recoil energy can be observed in one segment. As the photon energy is shared between several segments, there is no peaked distribution in any single segment. This could partially be recovered by segment energy
summation. In the third case, the recoil energy is observed in one segment, while the photon is observed in another segment. To disentangle the photon peak from the recoil energy distribution, energy spectra of all the segments are added to get a spectrum of the energy deposited in \emph{any segment}. In this spectrum, the type~1 events produce the same distribution as in the core spectrum and type~2 events form a flat distribution. Type~3 events, however, create a sharp photon peak at the original energy and an enhancement in the low energy region, the recoil energy distribution.

Figure \ref{fig:neu:cas} shows the \emph{any segment} spectrum (black) together with the core spectrum (grey) in the relevant energy ranges. Three peaks at 596~keV, 834~keV and 1039~keV, associated with inelastic scattering, $^{74}$Ge$(n, n^\prime\gamma)$, $^{72}$Ge$(n, n^\prime\gamma)$ and $^{70}$Ge$(n, n^\prime\gamma)$, respectively, are clearly visible in the \emph{any segment} spectrum. The latter two are not observable in the core spectrum.

\begin{figure}[tbhp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,clip]{spe_casp}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,clip]{spe_cas2p}
\caption{The \emph{any segment} spectrum (black) and the core spectrum (grey) in the relevant energy ranges. The disentangled photon peaks are much more significant than the original peaks.}
\label{fig:neu:cas}
\end{figure}

It is possible to extract the number of each type of events in the 596~keV peak. The total number of events, $N_{total}$ was determined from the core spectrum. An exponential function was fitted to the shoulder of the peak associated with the nuclear recoil energy distribution. A Gaussian function was fitted to the 609~keV background photon peak on the shoulder simultaneously. The background below the recoil structure was obtained from interpolating the spectrum below and above the shoulder. The total number of events is the difference between the fitted exponential and the background. The error was estimated by assuming different levels and shapes of the background. The fit is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:neu:f596}.

\begin{figure}[tbhp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fit596}
\caption{Close-up of the 596~keV peak in the core spectrum. The dashed line represents the background, the solid line shows the exponential plus Gaussian function from the background peak at 609~keV. A detailed description of the fitting is given in the text.}
\label{fig:neu:f596}
\end{figure}

The number of type~3 events, $N_{type3}$, was obtained by fitting a Gaussian function plus a first-order polynomial to the 596~keV peak in the \emph{any segment} spectrum. The small shoulder caused by the contamination with type~1 events does not change the results of the fit significantly.

In principle, the number of type~1 events can be determined by fitting the 596 keV peak in the \emph{single segment} spectrum obtained by requiring only one segment showing a signal. However, a trigger threshold of 5~keV had to be used for each segment in order to avoid electronic noise. Because the recoil energy is often smaller than 5~keV, a lot of type~3 events are recorded as type~1 events. Thus, the 596 keV peak in the \emph{single segment} spectrum contains all the type~1 events and a large part of type~3 events.

Another way to determine the number of type~1 events requires the study of the peaks purely induced by photons. This provides the probability that a de-excitation photon deposits its energy in exactly one or in multiple segments. The relative strength of the peaks in the core and any segment spectrum, that is, $\mathcal{R}(E_{\gamma}) = N_{core}(E_{\gamma}) / N^{any}_{seg}(E_{\gamma}) = (N_{SSE} + N_{MSE}) / N_{SSE}$, directly translates to the relative rate of the total number of inelastic scattering events to the sum of type~1 and type~3 events, that is, $\mathcal{R}(E_{\gamma}^{inelastic}) = N_{total} / (N_{type1} + N_{type3})$.

A Gaussian function plus a first-order polynomial were fitted to eleven of the most prominent photon induced background peaks in the core and \emph{any segment} spectra, respectively. The numbers of events in the peaks from the fits were used to calculate the ratio, $\mathcal{R}(E_{\gamma})$, see Fig.~\ref{fig:neu:sf}. A second-order polynomial was fitted to get an estimate of the ratio at any energy, $\mathcal{R}(E)$. The number of type~1 events can be calculated as $N_{type1} = N_{total} / \mathcal{R}(E_{\gamma}^{inelastic}) - N_{type3}$.

\begin{figure}[tbhp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth,clip]{sf}
\caption{The ``core to any segment ratio'' at the energies of various photon induced peaks. The errors were taken from the fitting of the photon peaks. The line is a second-order polynomial fitted to the data points.}
\label{fig:neu:sf}
\end{figure}

The number of type~2 events can then be calculated as $N_{type2} = N_{total} - N_{type1} - N_{type3}$. The results concerning event topologies in the 596~keV peak are listed in the second row of Table~\ref{tab:neu:ncore}. The percentage of single-segment events, that is, $N_{type1}$, out of the total number of events is $\mathcal{P} = N_{type1} / N_{total} \approx 5\%$.

\begin{table}[tbhp]

595.8 & $1000 \pm 1000$ \footnote{The very large error is due to the propagation of errors of $N_{type1}$, $N_{total}$ and $\mathcal{R}$ according to the relation $N_{type1} = N_{total} / \mathcal{R} - N_{type3}$.} & $(10 \pm 3)\times10^3$ & $7285 \pm 218$ & $(18.4 \pm 2.5)\times10^3$ \\
834.0  & [0, 380] & [4100, 4700] & $2592 \pm 186$ & [6700, 7700] \\
1039.2 & [0, 240] & [2700, 3100] & $1429 \pm 182$ & [4100, 4800] \\
\end{tabular*}
\end{minipage}
\end{table}

The numbers of type~3 events in the 834~keV and 1039~keV peaks were obtained by fitting the \emph{any segment} spectrum. Since there is no peak at these two energies in the core spectrum, it is impossible to get $N_{total}$ from a fit. However, since the percentage $\mathcal{P} = N_{type1} / N_{total}$ decreases with energy, $\mathcal{P}$ at 834~keV and 1039~keV should be less than $\mathcal{P}$(596~keV). Taking into account the relation, $N_{type1} = N_{total}/\mathcal{R} - N_{type3}$, the ranges of numbers of events in different topologies in the 834~keV and 1039~keV peaks were calculated. They are listed in Table~\ref{tab:neu:ncore} as well.

Special events were selected to disentangle the recoil energy, $E_{recoil}$, spectrum from the photon of energy, $E_\gamma$, spectrum:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Exactly two segments with an energy deposit above 10~keV were required.
\item If one segment had an energy deposit in the range $[E_\gamma-3\sigma, E_\gamma+3\sigma]$, where $\sigma$ was the detector energy resolution, the energy deposited in the other segment was used.
\end{enumerate}

The following steps produced the background to the recoil spectra:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Exactly two segments with an energy deposit above 10~keV were required.
\item Two energy side-bands, $[E_\gamma-6\sigma, E_\gamma-3\sigma]$ and $[E_\gamma+3\sigma, E_\gamma+6\sigma]$ were defined.
\item If one segment had an energy deposit in the side-bands, the energy deposited in the other segment was used.
\end{enumerate}

Figure~\ref{fig:neu:recoil} shows the disentangled recoil spectra related to the 596~keV, 834~keV and 1039~keV photon peaks. The histograms start at 10~keV. Below, the spectra are dominated by electronic noise. The recoil spectra extending to $\approx 100$~keV are clearly visible above the background.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Internal conversion}
\label{sec:neu:conv}
If the excited state of a nucleus has the same spin as the ground state, internal conversion \cite{Lis69, Kra56} is the predominant mode of the de-excitation. Since the mean free path of an electron emitted from internal conversion is about 1~mm in germanium, the energy of the electron and the recoil of the nucleus are deposited in the same segment. The core and the \emph{any segment} spectra are the same. This is demonstrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:neu:cas}. The 692~keV peak from internal conversion, $^{72}$Ge$(n,n'e)$, is neither changed nor suppressed in the \emph{any segment} spectrum.

\subsection{Double escape peaks}
\label{sec:neu:dep}
The photons from neutron induced interactions can subsequently induce double escape events in pair production. The double escape peaks are enhanced in the \emph{any segment} spectrum, because many events from the single escape and full energy peaks in the core spectrum move to this peak. Two enhanced double escape peaks at 1200~keV and 1592~keV are clearly visible in Fig.~\ref{fig:neu:cas}. The peak at 1200~keV originates from the 2223~keV peak of $^{1}$H$(n,\gamma)$ thermal capture. The 1592~keV peak originates from the 2614~keV peak of $^{208}$Tl; This is not a neutron induced interaction.


\section{Verification of simulation}
\label{sec:neu:sim}
The Geant4 \cite{Gea03, Gea06} based simulation package MaGe, as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:ph:sim}, was used to simulate the experiment. The version Geant4 8.2 with patch-01 was used.

\subsection{Generator, geometry and physics processes}
\label{sec:simdetail}
The neutron spectrum of an AmBe source taken from Fig.~5 in Ref.~\cite{Mar95} was normalized to a probability density function and used in the neutron generator to assign energies to the outgoing neutrons. The generator also produced 4.4 MeV photons from the $^{12}$C$^{*}$ de-excitation inside the AmBe source. The Doppler broadening of the 4.4 MeV peak was simulated by Gaussian smearing with the observed widths taken from Table~\ref{tab:neu:peak2}.

The geometry of the experiment was implemented according to the technical drawings. Approximations up to several centimeters had to be made regarding
\begin{itemize}
\item the shape and size of the AmBe source and how it was held inside the paraffin collimator,
\item the exact relative positions of the crystal and the paraffin collimator,
\item the exact geometry of the components inside the cryostat.
\end{itemize}

Geant4 provides high precision models for the simulation of interactions of neutrons with energies below 20~MeV \cite{Gea03, Gea06}. The models rely on the ``evaluated neutron data library'' (G4NDL) for cross sections, angular distributions and final state information. The version G4NDL3.10 was used.

\subsection{Core spectrum}
\label{sec:neu:spemc}
Figure~\ref{fig:neu:mca} shows the simulated core energy spectrum. The threshold effects below 100~keV were not taken into account in the simulation. Figure~\ref{fig:neu:mc} compares the simulation with the measurement in the range of [0.1, 3]~MeV. The background was normalized to data as described in section \ref{sec:neu:spec}. The simulation was normalized to data according to the relation, $N_{data} = N_{background} + N_{signal} = N_{background} + N_{simulation}$, where the $N$s are the event numbers in the data, background and simulated spectra. Figure~\ref{fig:neu:mcl} shows the same spectra in the range of [3, 10.2]~MeV.

\subsection{Discrepancies between data and simulation}
\label{sec:neu:dine}
In general the simulation describes the data very well. Some discrepancies are discussed here.

The shapes of the continuous spectra from the simulation and data above $\approx 1.5$~MeV deviate due to the poor knowledge of the exact material and geometry of components between the source and the crystal.

There is a known bug \cite{g4bug1} in Geant4 concerning neutron inelastic scatterings. The secondary particles are not boosted back to the laboratory frame after the calculations in the center of mass frame are completed. This causes two problems:
\begin{itemize}
\item The simulated recoil energies of the germanium nuclei are wrong.
\item The photon peaks from these interactions are not broadened.
\end{itemize}

The first effect is demonstrated in the third inset of Fig.~\ref{fig:neu:mc}. The measured 596~keV peak from $^{74}$Ge$(n,n^\prime\gamma)$ has a long tail on the high energy side due to the nuclear recoil while the simulated peak misses this feature.

The second effect is demonstrated by the inset of Fig.~\ref{fig:neu:mcl}.  The simulation generates a broad and a narrow peak, both at 4.4~MeV.  The broad peak is due to the de-excitation of $^{12}$C$^{*}$ created in the source. The generator was adjusted to describe the data. The narrow one is due to neutron inelastic scattering on carbon atoms in the paraffin collimator, $^{12}$C$(n,n'\gamma)$. In reality, the carbon atom can gain a velocity of up to $0.02c$ causing a Doppler broadening of the order of 50~keV-100~keV. This is comparable to the broadening in the $^{12}$C$^{*}$ de-excitation peak, and can, thus, not be resolved in the measured spectrum.

Another problem was observed in connection with the $^{1}$H$(n,\gamma)$ photon peak of 2223~keV. The mean value from a Gaussian fit to this peak is $(2223.24 \pm 0.01)$~keV. The simulated peak centers at $(2224.61 \pm 0.01)$~keV. This shifted value comes from the evaluated neutron data library. The problem was reported to the Geant4 Problem Tracking System \cite{g4bug2}. It was fixed for our studies by correcting the value in the database. The result is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:neu:h2223}.

\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{h2223}
\caption{The 2223~keV photon peak from $^{1}$H$(n,\gamma)$ in data and simulation. The spectra were normalized according to the numbers in the photon peaks. The simulated peak was shifted to 2224.6~keV before the modification described in the text.}
\label{fig:neu:h2223}
\end{figure}

The 139~keV and 196~keV photon peaks from the meta-stable states of $^{75}$Ge and $^{71}$Ge produced by neutron capture are missing in the simulated neutron spectrum, see the first two insets of Fig.~\ref{fig:neu:mc}. This problem has been reported to the Geant4 Problem Tracking System \cite{g4bug3}.

The 692~keV peak from internal conversion, $^{72}$Ge$(n,n^{\prime}e)$, is also missing in the simulation, see Fig.~\ref{fig:neu:mc}. Again, this was reported \cite{g4bug4}.

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:neu:out}
The 18-fold segmented germanium detector, Siegfried I, was exposed to an AmBe neutron source and spectra were taken. A number of peaks from neutron interactions on germanium isotopes as well as the surrounding materials were identified. The segment information proved to be very helpful in identifying these peaks. Inelastic neutron scattering produces many events with energy deposits in more than one segment. Hence, the improved understanding of neutron induced interactions can also help to reduce the related background in the $0\nu2\beta$ decay experiment, GERDA.

The Geant4 based simulation package, MaGe, was used to simulate the experiment. While the description was in general very good, several discrepancies between data and MC were found. Most of them were corrected. Some further verification and improvement of the related Geant4 codes are needed.
